# NashvilleHousing-Data-Cleaning-porfolio

This project focuses on cleaning up the Nashville housing data set using SQL queries to improve its usability and reliability.
The cleaned data set includes changes to the date format, populated property address data, divided address into individual columns of address and city, and removal of duplicates.
SQL was used as the primary technology to perform data cleaning on the data set.
The cleaning process follows best practices and ensures the accuracy of the data set.
Users can download the cleaned data set in CSV format for use in their own analysis.
The project also includes SQL scripts for data visualization and exploration.
This project is open source, and contributions are welcome.
Feel free to use the cleaned data set for your own analysis, but please give credit to this project.
If you have any issues or questions, please submit them through the GitHub issues page.
